This directory should contain the datasets from MS-COCO captioning 2014 benchmark.
The images and annotations should be contained in the sub-directory "coco/data"

Also, I used COCO API for evaluation.
You can install it by cloning the COCO API git repo. 
The repo should be placed under the sub-directory named "coco/cocoapi"
